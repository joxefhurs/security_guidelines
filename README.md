| **Error Handling**          | - Use custom error pages<br>- Securely log errors without exposing sensitive information                | Custom error pages, Monolog                      | Prevents leakage of sensitive information through error messages and improves user experience. |
| **Database Security**       | - Use least privilege principle<br>- Encrypt sensitive data<br>- Regular backups                        | MySQL user permissions, TLS/SSL, encrypted backups | Limits potential damage by restricting database user permissions and protecting data. |
| **Data Protection**         | - Implement CSRF protection<br>- Sanitize outputs to prevent XSS                                        | CSRF tokens, `htmlspecialchars()`                | Prevents unauthorized actions and ensures output is safe from injection attacks. |
| **File Uploads**            | - Restrict file types and sizes<br>- Sanitize file names<br>- Store files securely                     | MIME type checks, unique file names              | Prevents malicious files from being uploaded and executed. |
| **HTTPS**                   | - Enforce HTTPS for all traffic                                                                        | TLS/SSL certificates                             | Encrypts data in transit to protect it from interception and tampering. |
| **Server Configuration**    | - Harden PHP and MySQL settings<br>- Disable unnecessary functions and services                        | PHP configuration, MySQL configuration           | Reduces attack surface by limiting available features and services. |
| **Updates**                 | - Keep software and dependencies up to date                                                            | Regular patch management                          | Protects against known vulnerabilities by applying security patches. |
| **Code Reviews**            | - Conduct thorough code reviews focusing on security aspects                                           | Code review tools, peer reviews                  | Identifies and mitigates potential security issues in the codebase. |
| **Static Analysis**         | - Use tools for static code analysis to find vulnerabilities                                           | Static analysis tools                            | Detects security vulnerabilities during development. |
| **Penetration Testing**     | - Perform regular penetration tests<br>- Use automated tools and manual testing                         | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite                             | Identifies and helps fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. |
| **Documentation**           | - Maintain security practice documentation<br>- Ensure compliance with regulations                      | Documentation tools, compliance checklists       | Provides a clear reference for security practices and ensures regulatory compliance. |
| **Incident Response**       | - Develop an incident response plan<br>- Implement monitoring and auditing                              | Incident response plan, monitoring tools         | Enables timely response to and recovery from security incidents. |
| **SQL Injection Protection** | - **Use Prepared Statements**: Always use parameterized queries.<br>- **Use ORM Libraries**: Employ ORMs.<br>- **Sanitize User Inputs**: Validate and sanitize all inputs.<br>- **Escape Special Characters**: Escape characters in dynamic queries.<br>- **Limit Database Permissions**: Restrict database user permissions.<br>- **Regularly Update Database and Libraries**: Apply patches and updates.<br>- **Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**: Filter malicious requests.<br>- **Conduct Code Reviews**: Review code for SQL injection vulnerabilities.<br>- **Perform Regular Security Testing**: Use scanners and manual testing.<br>- **Educate Developers**: Train developers on SQL injection risks.<br>- **Use Security Headers**: Implement headers for overall security. | PDO, MySQLi, ORM Libraries, Security scanners | Protects against SQL injection by ensuring secure query handling, reducing attack vectors, and improving overall security practices. |
| **General Security Practices** | - **Implement Logging**: Use logging for monitoring and auditing.<br>- **Use Rate Limiting**: Protect against brute-force attacks.<br>- **Secure APIs**: Use authentication and encryption for API endpoints.<br>- **Monitor Dependencies**: Keep track of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. | Logging frameworks, rate limiting tools, API security measures | Enhances overall security posture by monitoring, protecting against abuse, and securing interactions with external systems. |
